## Hi there 👋

I build systems that turn messy data into something useful. I work across ML, backend engineering, and high scale compute. I like problems that feel too heavy and I break them down until they move.

### What I’m working on
- I build models that read ICU data and create clean insights for clinicians. I use SQL, RAG, and prompt engineering to pull real signals from MIMIC 4.
- I design data pipelines that track equipment health and save real money. My work at Lockheed Martin cut engineering time and boosted efficiency.
- I write backend systems for fintech. At Build Up I improved payment flows, made merchant onboarding faster, and helped local businesses accept digital payments.
- I work on open audio recognition tools like DIY Shazam. I use HiPerGator to train models, run large audio searches, and benchmark fast fingerprint systems.
- I take on research projects that mix ML and quantum methods to find new materials for space photovoltaics. I build data and HPC workflows for the team.

### What I enjoy
- Building ML systems that create real impact  
- Writing backend code that scales  
- Working at the edge of data and engineering  

### What I’m learning
- Clinical AI  
- High performance computing  
- Reinforcement learning  
- Better system design
