Aadhitya Varshan Durgadevi Vijaisenthil  
🔭 I work on ML projects that read ICU data, build backend systems for fintech, and run large compute jobs on HiPerGator. I’ve built dashboards at Lockheed Martin, improved payment flows at Build Up, and shipped data tools at Dartexon.

🌱 I’m learning more about clinical AI, high scale compute, reinforcement learning, and systems design.

📗 Interests: Machine Learning, Clinical AI, Backend Engineering, Signal Processing, Data Systems, HPC

🍣 Fun facts: I like building side projects that push compute limits, and I grew up around tech and logistics before diving into data.

⭐ I help lead UF’s Data Science and Informatics Club, where we run projects, workshops, and partner events.
