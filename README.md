## Hi there 👋

I build systems that turn messy data into something useful. I work across ML, backend engineering, and high scale compute. I like problems that feel too heavy and I break them down until they move.

### What I enjoy
- Building ML systems that create real impact  
- Writing backend code that scales  
- Working at the edge of data and engineering  

### What I’m learning
- Clinical AI  
- High performance computing  
- Reinforcement learning  
- Better system design
